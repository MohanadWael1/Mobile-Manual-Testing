# 📱 Mobile Application Manual Testing 🛠️

Welcome to the **Mobile Application Manual Testing** project! 🚀

In this project, I focused on testing the **Login** and **Register** pages of a real mobile app available on Google Play. I wrote detailed test cases, covering all possible scenarios, including those tricky corner cases! 🕵️‍♂️

## 🌟 What's Inside?

- **Login Page**: Tested everything from valid logins to error scenarios.
- **Register Page**: Checked all user interactions to ensure a smooth registration process.

### 📝 Test Case Template:

I used the following columns to structure the test cases:

- **Test Condition**
- **ID**
- **Steps Description**
- **Actual Result**
- **Pass/Fail**
- **Defect ID**

Here's an example of what it looks like:

```
| Test Condition       | ID    | Steps Description           | Actual Result       | Pass/Fail | Defect ID |
|----------------------|-------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Validate Login       | TC001 | Enter valid credentials      | User logged in      | Pass      | -         |
| Validate Empty Fields| TC002 | Leave all fields empty       | Error message shown | Pass      | -         |
| Validate Invalid Email | TC003 | Enter invalid email format   | Error message shown | Pass      | DF001     |
```

## 🐞 Defect Hunting:

I documented every defect found during testing, so nothing slips through the cracks! 🐛

## 🎉 Why This Project Rocks:

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Covered all possible scenarios.
- **Real-World Application**: Tested on a live app from Google Play.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Every step and defect is carefully recorded.

## 📸 Screenshot Time!

Here's where you can add a screenshot of the test case document:
